alert_manager
=============

Manage Mozilla performance alerts generated by talos.

# Installation

The production alert_manager server is running on Ubuntu, so this is
probably the easiest environment in which to get things running, but other
distributions of linux should be fine as well. We use Apache on the
production server, but Ouija will run standalone for testing as well.

## Dependencies:
* MySQL
* Python
* MySql-python

## Creating an config.ini file

The alert_manager uses a config.ini file to store identification and options.
You can create a default config.ini file by running:

    python config.py

Change the username and password for the database as required.

You will also either need a subscription to the mozilla.dev.tree-management
newsgroup, or make use of the sample data packaged in the sample folder.

## Database configuration:
Create the MySQL database using the schema.sql script as follows, where the
specified username matches the one in config.ini:

    mysql --user <username> --password < schema.sql

This will create a database called alerts, with a single table, also called
alerts. You can use the parse_news.py script to populate the database if
you wish, but sample data is also included in the sample folder. To use it:

    cd sample
    bunzip2 july_alerts.sql.bz2
    mysql --user <username> --password --database alerts < july_alerts.sql

## Start the app
Start the application:

    python server.py

You should see alert_manager running at http://localhost:8159/alerts.html.
